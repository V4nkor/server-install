# server-install.sh
A bash project designed to make seting up a web server easier. It is still in early development, so do not expect a lot of functionalities yet.

Works on linux -> Tested on a Debian machine, milleage may vary on a different OS for now.

# Setup :
To install the script, do :  
```
git clone https://github.com/V4nkor/server-install.git
```
I am planning to create a .deb package to unpack with dpkg.  

If not executable :  
```
sudo chmod u+x server-install.sh
```
To launch the script (you must use sudo or be root) :  
```
sudo ./server-install.sh
```
